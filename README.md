This is game project.

I want to simulate all in origin game, but actually, after I use `ffdec` tool to get all picture in origin flash game but then when I use pixel collision test for it by RGB, it is really slow. 
Actually, I should draw by myself and use maths expression to test. Then it will be really fast.
